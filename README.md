# requirement-analysis

## 📌 Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the **Requirement Analysis Project**, which aims to simulate a real-world software development scenario by focusing on the requirement analysis phase for a Booking Management System.

The goal is to provide structured, well-documented, and visual representations of both functional and non-functional requirements. This serves as a foundational step in building scalable and efficient software systems. 

Through this project, I aim to practice and demonstrate key skills in:
- Documenting requirements clearly and professionally.
- Identifying use cases and actors through diagrams.
- Structuring project insights that align with user and business needs.

This repository will evolve as each task in the project is completed.

## 📖 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where stakeholders, developers, and analysts collaborate to gather, analyze, validate, and document the necessary requirements for building a software system.

It serves as the foundation for the entire development process, ensuring that the final product aligns with the expectations of users and meets business goals.

### 🔍 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting information from stakeholders (clients, users, managers) to understand what the system should do.
- **Requirement Classification**: Categorizing requirements into functional (what the system does) and non-functional (how the system performs).
- **Requirement Validation**: Ensuring that requirements are complete, feasible, and aligned with business needs.
- **Documentation**: Clearly recording all requirements using standardized formats, diagrams, or user stories.

### 🧩 Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle
- ✅ **Clarity**: Helps eliminate ambiguity and misunderstanding between stakeholders and developers.
- ✅ **Project Planning**: Informs accurate timelines, resources, and budgeting.
- ✅ **Risk Reduction**: Identifies potential issues early, reducing costly changes later in the process.
- ✅ **Quality Assurance**: Forms the basis for testing and validation of the final system.
- ✅ **Scope Control**: Prevents scope creep by clearly defining and controlling feature expectations.

In summary, Requirement Analysis ensures that the software system is built **right from the start**, reducing rework, increasing efficiency, and boosting client satisfaction.

## ❗ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in ensuring the success of any software development project. Below are three key reasons why it is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

### 1. ✅ Aligns Software with Business Goals
By gathering and analyzing stakeholder requirements, development teams ensure the software solution directly supports business objectives. This alignment reduces wasted effort and increases return on investment by building features that matter most.

### 2. ✅ Prevents Costly Errors and Rework
Early identification of unclear, conflicting, or incomplete requirements helps catch issues before development begins. Fixing problems during the requirement phase is significantly less expensive than correcting them during or after implementation.

### 3. ✅ Facilitates Better Communication and Understanding
Requirement Analysis creates a shared understanding between all stakeholders (clients, users, developers, and testers). Clearly documented requirements minimize miscommunication and ensure everyone is on the same page throughout the development process.

By investing time in proper Requirement Analysis, teams can build software that is reliable, user-focused, and delivered on time and within budget.

## 🛠️ Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis is made up of several core activities that ensure the software development process starts with a clear and shared understanding of what needs to be built. Below are the five key activities involved:

- **📥 Requirement Gathering**  
  This involves collecting high-level requirements from stakeholders such as clients, users, and business managers. It focuses on identifying what the stakeholders need from the system.

- **🧠 Requirement Elicitation**  
  Elicitation goes beyond simple gathering. It involves engaging stakeholders through interviews, surveys, brainstorming sessions, and workshops to deeply understand their needs, expectations, and constraints.

- **📝 Requirement Documentation**  
  All gathered and elicited requirements are organized and recorded in a clear, structured format. This ensures all stakeholders and team members have a reliable reference and reduces the risk of misinterpretation.

- **📊 Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  In this step, requirements are reviewed, refined, and categorized. Use case diagrams, data flow diagrams, and other visual tools may be used to model how the system will behave and interact with users.

- **✔️ Requirement Validation**  
  Finally, the documented and modeled requirements are validated with stakeholders to ensure accuracy, feasibility, and alignment with business goals. This step confirms that the requirements are ready for design and development.
