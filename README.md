# requirement-analysis

## üìå Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the **Requirement Analysis Project**, which aims to simulate a real-world software development scenario by focusing on the requirement analysis phase for a Booking Management System.

The goal is to provide structured, well-documented, and visual representations of both functional and non-functional requirements. This serves as a foundational step in building scalable and efficient software systems. 

Through this project, I aim to practice and demonstrate key skills in:
- Documenting requirements clearly and professionally.
- Identifying use cases and actors through diagrams.
- Structuring project insights that align with user and business needs.

This repository will evolve as each task in the project is completed.

## üìñ What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where stakeholders, developers, and analysts collaborate to gather, analyze, validate, and document the necessary requirements for building a software system.

It serves as the foundation for the entire development process, ensuring that the final product aligns with the expectations of users and meets business goals.

### üîç Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting information from stakeholders (clients, users, managers) to understand what the system should do.
- **Requirement Classification**: Categorizing requirements into functional (what the system does) and non-functional (how the system performs).
- **Requirement Validation**: Ensuring that requirements are complete, feasible, and aligned with business needs.
- **Documentation**: Clearly recording all requirements using standardized formats, diagrams, or user stories.

### üß© Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle
- ‚úÖ **Clarity**: Helps eliminate ambiguity and misunderstanding between stakeholders and developers.
- ‚úÖ **Project Planning**: Informs accurate timelines, resources, and budgeting.
- ‚úÖ **Risk Reduction**: Identifies potential issues early, reducing costly changes later in the process.
- ‚úÖ **Quality Assurance**: Forms the basis for testing and validation of the final system.
- ‚úÖ **Scope Control**: Prevents scope creep by clearly defining and controlling feature expectations.

In summary, Requirement Analysis ensures that the software system is built **right from the start**, reducing rework, increasing efficiency, and boosting client satisfaction.
