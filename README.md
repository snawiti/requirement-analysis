# requirement-analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the **Requirement Analysis Project**, which aims to simulate a real-world software development scenario by focusing on the requirement analysis phase for a Booking Management System.

The goal is to provide structured, well-documented, and visual representations of both functional and non-functional requirements. This serves as a foundational step in building scalable and efficient software systems. 

Through this project, I aim to practice and demonstrate key skills in:
- Documenting requirements clearly and professionally.
- Identifying use cases and actors through diagrams.
- Structuring project insights that align with user and business needs.

This repository will evolve as each task in the project is completed.
